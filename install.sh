# Fetches the latest .deb from this repo's GitHub Releases ("latest" rolling
# build) and installs it with apt. Safe to re-run any time you want to
# update -- it's the exact same command for install and update.
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abuu20/portal-releases/main/install.sh | sudo bash
#
# Or download it first and read it before running, which is always a
# reasonable thing to do with a script piped into a shell:
#
#   curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abuu20/portal-releases/main/install.sh
#   less install.sh
#   sudo bash install.sh
#
# This repo (portal-releases) holds only the built .deb -- no source code.
# PORTAL's source lives in a private repo; this one exists so this command
# can work without any authentication.
